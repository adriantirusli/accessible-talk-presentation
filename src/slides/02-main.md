> The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability.

> When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.

## Great presentation is not about a **fancy topic** and **cool slide**, but **the speaker**.

# You can do better. But How?

---

# Let's do breakdown to 4 steps
* Planning your Session
* Preparing Slides
* Presenting Tips
* After Presentation

---

# Planning your Session

---

## Provide material ahead of time, IF REQUESTED
Offer handouts, slides, and other material in accessible formats   

---

## Work with interpreters, translators, and CART writers
Give them material in advance. Explain acronyms, terms, names, etc. that you will use. Be available to answer questions.

---

## Caption audio, or otherwise make it available
Ideally, any audio you use is also available in text, for example, videos are captioned. However, if CART is provided for your presentation, that can provide text of the audio.

---

## Use multiple communication methods for different learning styles
Some people can better understand verbal information. Other people can better understand pictures and diagrams. And others better understand text.

---

# Preparing Slides

---

## Make your font-size big. No, BIGGER!
People up the back and people with vision impairments will appreciate every extra pixel you add to your font size.   
Go Big or Go Home.

---

## Is your font readable?
According to [British Dyselexia Style Guide 2018](https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/common/ckeditor/filemanager/userfiles/Dyslexia_Style_Guide_2018-final.pdf): Use sans serif, be generous with spacing, use bold for emphasis, use mixed case.

---

## Does it make sense on greyscale?
There’s also a good chance that someone at your talk is color-blind.

---

## Your slide is not a Novel
Slides aren’t speaker notes.

---

## Animated Transition? Seriously?
Slide transitions and other animation such as parallax scrolling can trigger nausea, headaches and dizziness in people with vestibular (inner ear) disorders.

---

## GIF aren't always funny
If the GIF content strobes or flashes rapidly, it may trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.

---

## Keep your links short
Watch the readability and say-ability.

---

# Presenting Tips

---

## Breath...
You’re nervous.      
You’ve never presented before.    
You’ve got a time limit and lots to share.     
You haven’t practiced.      
Your parents, friends, workmates, managers and "uhuk" crush are all in the room.

---

## Have a clear direction
Better start with **spoiler**.   
"Here we have bla, bla and bla"

---

## Give the audience time to read
Consider how much time your audience need to read your slide before moving to another.

---

## Provide content/trigger warnings or avoid sensitive content
It may depend on your topic and audience, but **avoid sensitive content** that can affect your audience members. 

---

# After Presentation

---

## Distribute accessible slide
Correct semantics, meaningful read order, ALT text on images, enough color contrast, video captions, limited animation looping, reasonable slide transitions, all the good stuff.

---

## Provide different format of your slide
Publish your **speaker notes** or a **companion piece** that covers your topic(s).

To exclude **no one**.

# Have you ever heard Web Accessibility? 🧐
*even tho i know your answer is "Duh", I still want to ask

> The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. 
>
> When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.

## Great presentation is not about a **fancy topic** and **cool slide**, but **the speaker**.

## Contoh Gambar:
"Ya temen-temen bisa lihat gambar-gambar di slide yang merupakan beberapa contoh dari A (nyodorin gambar seabrek sambil dijelaskan maksudnya apa)"

---

## Contoh Video:
"Mari kita saksikan video alur dari fitur B (muterin video, ternyata videonya ga punya subtitle)"

---

## Contoh Grafik:
"Berikut merupakan grafik yang menunjukkan nilai Y di Indonesia dalam 6 bulan terakhir (nunjukkin grafik warna-warni, habis itu diem 5 detik ngebiarin audience liat grafik aja)"

# You can do better. But How?

---

# Let's do breakdown to 4 steps
1. Planning your Session
2. Preparing Slides
3. Presenting Tips
4. After Presentation

---

# Planning your Session

---

## Provide material ahead of time, IF REQUESTED
Offer handouts, slides, and other material in accessible formats   

---

## Work with interpreters, translators, and CART writers
Give them material in advance. Explain acronyms, terms, names, etc. that you will use. Be available to answer questions.

---

## Caption audio, or otherwise make it available
Ideally, any audio you use is also available in text, for example, videos are captioned. However, if CART is provided for your presentation, that can provide text of the audio.

---

## Use multiple communication methods for different learning styles
Some people can better understand verbal information. Other people can better understand pictures and diagrams. And others better understand text.

---

# Preparing Slides

---

## Make your font-size big. No, BIGGER!
People up the back and people with vision impairments will appreciate every extra pixel you add to your font size.   
Go Big or Go Home.

---

## Is your font readable?
There’s more scope to experiment with fonts on slides than web pages due to the larger text size, but here are some best practices:   
* Sans serif is typically the most readable.
* Be generous with spacing (between letters, words, and lines).
* Use bold for emphasis — underline and italic change the letter shapes, making them less identifiable.
* Use mixed case, not all caps.

---

## Does it make sense on greyscale?
There’s also a good chance that someone at your talk is color-blind.

---

## Your slide is not a Novel
Slides aren’t speaker notes.

---

## Animated Transition? Seriously?
Slide transitions and other animation such as parallax scrolling can trigger nausea, headaches and dizziness in people with vestibular (inner ear) disorders.

---

## GIF aren't always funny
If the GIF content strobes or flashes rapidly, it may trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.

---

## Keep your links short
Watch the readability and say-ability.

---

# Presenting Tips

---

## Breath...
You’re nervous.      
You’ve never presented before.    
You’ve got a time limit and lots to share.     
You haven’t practiced.      
Your parents, friends, workmates, managers and "uhuk" crush are all in the room.

---

## Have a clear direction
Better start with **spoiler**.   
"Here we have bla, bla and bla"

---

## It is important to provide talk that is accessible
